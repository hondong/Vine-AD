Description: This package is written to demonstrate that by using automatic differentiation tools, gradients, as well as higher level derivatives, can be computed than current computational practice. This package is associated to the submitted (code snippet) "Faster Estimation of High-Dimensional Vine Copulas with Automatic Differentiation" submitted to the Journal of Statistical Software.
